# Submarine Robotics Introduction
SUV - Small Underwater Vehicle. Codename WAILMER
# What does the robot look like?
(1) Robot Configuration: This robot has a confuguration as follows. It has in total 6 thrusters with four (1-4) for leveling and depth control, and two (5-6) for horizontal motion control (forward, backward, turning).
